# cpp-sockets - Simple server and client chat for linux

A simple socket programming which creates a connection between two terminals in linux.

# Execution

1. Compile server.cpp and client.cpp and run them on two different terminals. (I have already provided with the compiled files.)

2. Always end your message with " *", so as to switch between server and client.
